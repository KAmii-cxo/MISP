# MISP - Malware Information Sharing Platform

MISP is an open-source threat intelligence platform designed to improve the sharing and analysis of cyber threat data. It facilitates collaboration between organizations, CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams), ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers), and other security professionals by providing a centralized hub for storing, sharing, and correlating threat intelligence.

## Features
- **Data Sharing**: Securely share and collaborate on threat intelligence with trusted partners and communities.
- **Threat Intelligence Storage**: Centralized repository for storing indicators of compromise (IoCs), malware samples, attack patterns, and more.
- **Correlation and Enrichment**: Automatically correlates data to identify relationships between different threats, actors, and campaigns.
- **Standards Compliant**: Fully supports open standards like **STIX** (Structured Threat Information Expression) and **TAXII** (Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information) for seamless data exchange.
- **API Integration**: RESTful API for easy integration with SIEMs, firewalls, endpoint protection, and other cybersecurity tools.
- **Community Driven**: Open-source and community-oriented, with active contributions from a wide range of organizations.

## Use Cases
- **Incident Response**: Use MISP to enhance the response to ongoing incidents by leveraging shared threat data.
- **Threat Hunting**: Empower threat hunters with enriched IoC data to proactively search for potential attacks in your network.
- **Malware Analysis**: Share and retrieve detailed information about malware families, behaviors, and mitigation strategies.
- **Collaboration**: Enable collaboration between different organizations, enhancing the collective defense against emerging threats.

## Example Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Threat data (hashes, domains, IPs, TTPs, etc.) is ingested into the platform.
2. **Data Correlation**: MISP automatically correlates and enriches the data with context, such as attack patterns or related threat actors.
3. **Sharing**: The enriched threat intelligence is shared securely with trusted partners or communities.
4. **Action**: Organizations take action by updating security measures, creating detection rules, or investigating ongoing attacks.
