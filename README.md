# MISP

# MISP - Malware Information Sharing Platform

MISP is an open-source threat intelligence platform designed to improve the sharing and analysis of cyber threat data. It facilitates collaboration between organizations, CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams), ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers), and other security professionals by providing a centralized hub for storing, sharing, and correlating threat intelligence.

## Features
- **Data Sharing**: Securely share and collaborate on threat intelligence with trusted partners and communities.
- **Threat Intelligence Storage**: Centralized repository for storing indicators of compromise (IoCs), malware samples, attack patterns, and more.
- **Correlation and Enrichment**: Automatically correlates data to identify relationships between different threats, actors, and campaigns.
- **Standards Compliant**: Fully supports open standards like **STIX** (Structured Threat Information Expression) and **TAXII** (Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information) for seamless data exchange.
- **API Integration**: RESTful API for easy integration with SIEMs, firewalls, endpoint protection, and other cybersecurity tools.
- **Community Driven**: Open-source and community-oriented, with active contributions from a wide range of organizations.

## Use Cases
- **Incident Response**: Use MISP to enhance the response to ongoing incidents by leveraging shared threat data.
- **Threat Hunting**: Empower threat hunters with enriched IoC data to proactively search for potential attacks in your network.
- **Malware Analysis**: Share and retrieve detailed information about malware families, behaviors, and mitigation strategies.
- **Collaboration**: Enable collaboration between different organizations, enhancing the collective defense against emerging threats.

## MISP Core Functionalities

MISP provides several core functionalities that are key to its operation:

1. **IOC Database**: Stores both technical and non-technical information related to malware samples, incidents, attackers, and intelligence.
2. **Automatic Correlation**: Identifies relationships between attributes and indicators from malware, attack campaigns, or analysis.
3. **Data Sharing**: Facilitates sharing information using different distribution models across multiple MISP instances.
4. **Import & Export Features**: Supports importing and exporting events in various formats for integration with other systems, such as NIDS, HIDS, and OpenIOC.
5. **Event Graph**: Displays the relationships between objects and attributes identified in events.
6. **API Support**: Allows integration with custom systems for fetching and exporting events and intelligence.

## Common Terms in MISP

The following terms are frequently used within MISP and are essential to understanding its functionalities:

- **Events**: A collection of contextually linked information.
- **Attributes**: Individual data points associated with an event, such as network or system indicators.
- **Objects**: Custom compositions of attributes.
- **Object References**: Relationships between different objects.
- **Sightings**: Time-specific occurrences of a data point or attribute detected to enhance credibility.
- **Tags**: Labels attached to events or attributes.
- **Taxonomies**: Classification libraries used to tag, classify, and organize information.
- **Galaxies**: Knowledge base items used for labeling events or attributes.
- **Indicators**: Information pieces that detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity.


## Example Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Threat data (hashes, domains, IPs, TTPs, etc.) is ingested into the platform.
2. **Data Correlation**: MISP automatically correlates and enriches the data with context, such as attack patterns or related threat actors.
3. **Sharing**: The enriched threat intelligence is shared securely with trusted partners or communities.
4. **Action**: Organizations take action by updating security measures, creating detection rules, or investigating ongoing attacks.
